This project implements a ToDo application leveraging React's component-based architecture to demonstrate fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It utilizes React's props and state mechanisms for data management and component communication, providing a clear illustration of unidirectional data flow and stateful component logic within a modern front-end framework.
